# CRUD App - Employee Management System

Welcome to the **CRUD App** project! This repository contains a simple and responsive employee management system built using **HTML**, **CSS (Bootstrap)**, and **JavaScript with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the application [here](https://rahmayahiaa.github.io/CRUD-APP/).

## Features

- **Add Employees**: Users can add new employees by filling out their name, email, and mobile number.
- **Edit Employees**: Users can update an existing employee's information.
- **Delete Employees**: Users can remove an employee from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: Employee data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so it remains saved even after the page is refreshed or closed.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the web page.
- **CSS (Bootstrap)**: Used for styling and to ensure the app is responsive.
- **JavaScript (OOP)**: Adds dynamic functionality to manage employee records and interact with `localStorage`.
